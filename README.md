# My Vault

Here you will find a comprehensive list of the free and mostly open source software I use on a daily basis.

I initially made this list as a personal reference as I tend to forget what I find and have to search for it again which is frustrating and cumbersome.

The list of softwares is [here](Sofwares.md). It mostly contains software I use on my windows machine.

I'll gradually add my configs, manuals and linux software here as well.
